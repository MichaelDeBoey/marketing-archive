        Financial independence has more to do with avoiding screw-ups than
        making sound decisions. Because for most people, keeping wealth is
        harder than acquiring it. For enduring wealth, a healthy combination of
        moderation (great savings rate!) and skepticism (ignoring the noise) is
        a proven formula.

        A long-term financial strategy should be built around survival.
        Compounding is incredible but it has one prerequisite - time. Meaning,
        it only works if you can stick around, stay focused, and avoid taking
        risks that will wipe you out.

        Focusing on what you can control is the key to boosting your financial
        health. And while many factors contribute to accumulating wealth â€” a
        robust savings rate can do most of the heavy lifting. You can save money
        on a high income, a low income, or a variable income. You simply have to
        set the goal, and stick to it.
